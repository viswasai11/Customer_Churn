# Telco-Customer-Churn
Welcome to the Telco Customer Churn Analysis project! In this project, we explore and analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset to gain insights into factors influencing customer churn. The dataset provides information about various features of telecom customers, such as their contract details, usage patterns, and whether they churned or not.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze the Telco Customer Churn dataset and derive meaningful insights into the factors influencing customer churn. Potential analysis areas include:
* Identifying features strongly correlated with customer churn.
* Analyzing the impact of contract type and payment method on churn.
* Developing a predictive model for customer churn.

## Dataset Overview
The Telco Customer Churn dataset consists of the following key columns:

| **Variable Name** | **Description** |
|--|--|
|customerID | The id of each customer|
|gender |Whether the customer is a male or a female |

|Partner |Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No) |
|Dependents |Whether the customer has dependents or not (Yes, No) |
|tenure |Number of months the customer has stayed with the company |
|PhoneService |Whether the customer has a phone service or not (Yes, No) |
